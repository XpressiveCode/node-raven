node-raven is a RavenDB client for Node.

var raven = require('node-raven');
var client = raven('http://localhost:8080');	// URL of your RavenDb server

To use this code you need to
npm install request

To test this code you also need to
npm install mocha
npm install should

These dependencies are in the package.json, so you can just 'npm install' to get them all.

The test script assumes a dedicated ravendb instance is running on http://localhost:8080, 
I suggest putting an empty server into a RavenDb sub folder and running up the Raven.Serer.exe
